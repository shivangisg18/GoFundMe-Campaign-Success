Shaun was beaten in his first ‘home’ by the people who were supposed to love and care for him, and then left at Hilbrae Rescue Kennels, where he has been since. He has spent 2 years waiting for his forever family. Shaun is so intelligent and smart, and has sadly struggled being in a kennel for such a long time. He is incredibly fearful and nervous of strangers, which causes him to be reactive, but gentle and loving with his trusted volunteers and staff. With the support from the amazing team at Maverick Mutts, Shaun has recently had the opportunity to work with a compassionate and talented behaviourist - Head Trainer Rachel at K9 Anytime. In his sessions, Shaun has demonstrated he is incredibly capable and willing to put in all 4 paws into his rehabilitation journey. Shaun has now had the offer a forever home, where he can continue his important training and finally be a dog - being loved and spoilt as he should have been all along! We are raising funds for secure fencing, and a warm and safe kennel for him to transition whilst he continues with his journey, and into his new life. This is Shaun’s chance to finally have the life he deserves, with people willing to commit to his training and work at it every day with him. A safe and secure kennel will support Shaun whilst he figures out the world (and people!) aren’t so bad. He is so deserving and has waited so long.

Many of you have also contacted me for advice for those that don’t need direct care but residents have raised concerns about. I have funded my own further education to care for hedgehogs the best way possible given our geography and logistics. I’ve been supported by very kind donations over the years however, I feel this autumn will be busy! We have had a very successful breeding year and I predict an equally busy autumn/winter. My facilities are extremely limited now as I used to house them in a spare room in the house which is no longer available. I would like to raise money for an external shed which we can heat and store up to 4 hedgehog houses.

Unfortunately, to find out what was causing his pain, we had to have an MRI, and from this, we got a diagnosis of TCS. The only realistic option to relieve his pain is surgery and from researching it seems the younger they have it, the better the outcome. I do have good insurance for him, but with all his tests so far (MRI and specialist consults came to over £3500 unfortunately we do not have enough left for his surgery (quoted between £4000 and £5000) until it renews which is almost a year away. I do realise that times are hard for everyone at the moment but if you could help towards the cost of Alfie's surgery I would be so grateful. If you aren't able to donate then please share to get Alfie's story to as many people as we can. Thank you ❤️\", 'Created 5 d ago', 'by Dylan for Rent, Food & Monthly Bills']\n",

Most of you will know of us and the kind of work our volunteers do to help abandoned and unwanted strays in the community. It's thanks to members of the public who notify us about these cats that we are able to locate them and bring them into care. We come across some horrific situations which are heartbreaking to say the least. One such cat is Dennis (see photo) who roamed the streets of Renfrew for many months and suffering with a massive abscess on his face. He is just one of the numerous un-neutered males out there who end up with war wounds due to fighting for territory. When we got Dennis to our vet it was discovered he had more to worry about than the abscess. His mouth was in a dreadful state with cracked and broken teeth. Since then Dennis has braved many return visits to the vet to flush out his wound which was badly infected. The wound is slowly healing and he has already had two teeth extracted and his mouth is stitched up. He will need at least one more visit to get the others out. We don't know what the final cost will be, but it will be a four figure sum for sure. We are doing this fundraiser for Dennis, to get him back on the road to good health. Despite his bad start in life Dennis is an absolute darling and hasn't flinched once while being handled by the vet. He has settled well in foster care and loves the attention he's getting, not to mention a warm and cozy home, something which was denied him before. Our funds are diminishing because we always have lots of cats who need vet care. We would like to extend our thanks to those of you who have donated in the past. If not for you we wouldn't still be active. Than you, Margaret\", 'Created 7 September 2025', 'by Dylan for Rent, Food & Monthly Bills']\n",

IT WAS FATE. Days later we decided we wanted to rescue this girl and bring her back to the UK to save her life as ALL stray dogs in Turkey are getting PTS. We couldn’t have her loose her life she is so sweet and loving, we had to help her. I paid fees myself to get her rescued and in a dog hotel which is going to cost me 100s. Once she’s done the quarantine part she will need importing from Turkey to the uk which is going to cost thousands. So I beg for your help to try raise the transportation costs.

But learn I did and I fell in love with the little grumpy looking fella and living on my own he’s been my companion now for 4 years and we have an amazing bond !! Last week I picked him up and touched what I now know was a sore spot on his back and he jumped out of my arms and was flayling his back legs on the floor and then layed there unable to move ! After a trip to an emergency vet and then an overnight care place he ended up in Southfields Vets in Basildon Essex. An MRI revealed one of the discs in his back had slipped leaving him in agony and unable to move his back legs ! At this point they though his legs may be paralysed and gave a chance of a successful operation at about 50% after a day or 2 of steroids and pain meds he got some felling and slight movement back they now say he has a 70% to 80% chance of a successful operation but the whole cost is £8000 to £9000 ! Like any responsible owner I have insurance but only up to £4000 as I never dreamed it could be this expensive! But apparently a slipped disc like this is rare in a cat ! I do work but live by myself and private rent so thinks are often a bit tight like for most of us , I’m raising what I can and selling some of my stuff also !!

      "   Found date text: [\"I picked up Bob, a 10-year-old dog, from a farmer who unfortunately treated him like a tool who kept him on a rope 24/7. Initially, I only took him for walks every two days, and his fur was very matted. When I finally took him home, I discovered he was a very timid dog, very scared, and afraid of everything around him. Slowly, step by step, he learned that people can be kind. After a few weeks, it turned out he had impaired vision and therefore is not suitable for working with a farmer. I've had Bob for four years now, and his life has changed dramatically. Unfortunately, at the end of July 2025, he began having problems with defecation, and after a visit to the vet, it turned out he had absess in his anus. We performed surgery, which cost £900. The period after the surgery was supposed to bring improvement. Unfortunately, his condition hasn't improved because he developed a hernia, which is painful and makes it very difficult for him to poop. To help him, he needs surgery, which unfortunately I can't afford. My son and I consider Bob a member of our family. We gave him a quiet, loving home so he wouldn't suffer anymore, so I'm asking for help from everyone. If anyone can donate anything, I'd be very grateful. Bob is a dog who loves walks, loves the beach, and loves people. On Bob's behalf, and mine, of course, I thank you very much for any help.\", 'Created 9 September 2025', 'by Dylan for Rent, Food & Monthly Bills']\n",

We took him off the streets and got him to a vets where it was discovered he has something inside his tummy-possibly a bleed- and a lump under his chin. He had a needle biopsy done which showed epithelial cells that are cuboidal and distributed in small clusters. It is thought to be a possible follicular/adnexal tumor but not thought to be cancerous thankfully. This s tumor is growing and needs to be removed and further tests to determine exactly what the cause is. As the tumor is growing and is on his neck this cannot be allowed to continue growing as it will obstruct his airway. He has another vet appointment to determine when this can be removed, sent to the lab for further testing, and either a scan or x-ray to check his abdomen. His collapsed ear is as a result of the harsh life he was subjected to but no action needed on it. He has already been to the vets twice, once to be neutered and chipped, but a lovely lady covered that for him, but was sedated so he could be thoroughly examined and the needle aspirate taken at a cost of . £402.57. Until he has his next vet visit this Thursday we will know a further cost for the tumor removal and scan or x-ray. Ollie really deserves all our help as he really has been so let down. Why nobody helped him for those 8 years after his owner abandoned him is incomprehensible and just so sad .', 'Created 23 September 2025']\n",

I’m fundraising for our boy bailey to be able to have the scans that will help us get the further treatment that he needs. Bailey is our 2 year old French Bulldog. After 4 trips to the vets this week they have suspected IVDD. Unfortunately they have told us they have done everything they can and can’t go any further unless he has an x ray and an mri scan which costs around £5k. We absolutely can’t afford that right now, obviously because of how expensive it is, but also due to taking time off work to look after him. Bailey is usually the most energetic and playful dog and this has all come on so suddenly, it’s awful to see him struggling and in pain.

Wagging her tail and barking at cars that drove past anyway we went to see if the dog was ok and to give it some water when we arrived to where the dog was we started to call the dog as we couldn't see it. Next thing the bushes started to move and 4 puppies came trotting out no more than 3 months old they were really happy to see us then mums comes over she looked so sad but happy to see us to she come over to me and at that moment she broke my heart cut a long story short the hotel said she was dumped at the side of the road pregnant she had gave birth to 4 beautiful puppies on small patch of dusty land the puppies stayed on the patch of land and never came off and mum would sit at the side of the road we now know she has been sat there for 6 months waiting for her cruel owners to pick her back up which obviously was never going to happen a day later I went and bought them all food bowls and water mum would let all the pups eat first before she even tried to take what was left at this time I had crumbled into a million pieces as i seen how much of a loving caring dog she was at that moment I had to make a choice to leave her and her beautiful puppies or do what ever is in my power to help the poor girl out so I have decided to bring them all home I can't do nothing. so I started searching the net I found a number to a women called ozlem but she was on the other side of Turkey so with her help I have managed to get her and all her babies picked up taken to the vets they have all been treated for parasites and other diseases and now they are all successfully in a boardings in antalya i have managed to pay for the vet bill today which was 100 dollars and have used some of my holiday money to pay for the boarding as they want $500 dollars a month just to hold them which I have paid and will continue to pay also i have managed to get them all to stay together to but at a price I can pay for most of it myself but need some help with the funds for paper work more vet bills. And getting them back I'm going to rent a van and drive there myself and bring them back i can't fly them as I will never be able to afford it but driving is ridiculously cheaper so I'm reaching out to all you dogs lovers and mates out there to try raise the funds to get them all home to there forever home with me back in the uk so all I ask is for you to have a heart and donate even if its 5p it's better than nothing many thanks and enough love gaz and Dawn x\", 'Created 25 September 2025', 'by Dylan for Rent, Food & Monthly Bills']\n",

The rescue was initially housed in outbuildings at Prune Park then, when I moved home in 2002, the rescue moved with me. Little did my husband Peter know that over 80% of his new home would end up as cat and kitten rooms. There is literally a cat around every corner, cat tree and hidey-hole. I open my bedroom door in a morning to be greeted by several cats waiting for their breakfast. These are mostly older cats who for some reason never get chosen but nevertheless get the care they deserve. These are in addition to those cats and kittens kept in kennels (for various reasons) and in five other rooms in the house. My private space consists of a sitting room, bedroom and bathroom and the cats even try to get in there. My daughter Tracy and I are committed to rescuing and rehoming cats and kittens but we cannot do it alone. We live in a world where many cats are abandoned and homeless or worse, are taken for dog baiting. It’s heartbreaking. Throughout the years we have brought countless cats in from the streets to safety, warmth, medical care and love. All the cats in our care get flea and worm treatment, are vaccinated, microchipped and neutered or spayed. There are often underlying medical conditions that also need expensive prescriptions to ease their pain and discomfort.

The vets at Kentdale were very concerned with Cosmo’s state & scheduled 2 major surgeries. 1 proved more difficult than first imagined due to the proximity of the damaged tissue & infection to the nerves of his eye, risking the entire right eye itself! They also had to do a skin graft (luckily from the saggy skin at his neck from the extreme swelling) onto his head where the wound burst open & had been left untreated.

Whenever I go away on holiday I always try to feed all the stray animals as I am a big animal lover. During my stay I found a litter of 6 beautiful kittens and unfortunately a deceased mother. Me and my friend Amy have been there 5 times a day feeding the litter of kittens to keep them alive. They were found under a derelict ice cream parlour that was part of an hotel that had shut down. The kittens were in a terrible state no mother we had to keep a close eye on them. Unfortunately 1 of the kittens didn't make it, but 5 were still going strong. One particular kitten was the strongest and she was the leader every day she would pop out from underneath the parlour and wanted fuss and was very cheeky. We called her Millie. She looked after her brothers and sisters and was full of life. Sarah from project paws rescue in Cyprus made room for them And we got them to a safe place eventually. I realised that I had a massive bond with Millie and cried for days when she left. I have now decided to adopt Millie and bring her back to that UK to meet my other cat princess. I have set this page up to raise money for the adoption of mille and help project paws with all there care during this process.

Milo is a 2-year-old Border Collie cherished by our entire family, including me, his mum, and his two human sisters. We all hold him in the highest regard. We welcomed him into our lives when he was just 10 weeks old, and he has always been a joyful and energetic companion. On September 17th, he underwent X-rays on his hips after he began to cry out while getting up and lying down. He started to lose his balance, walk with an unusual gait, and appeared rigid in his hindquarters. The X-rays revealed that he suffers from significant bilateral hip dysplasia. Although Milo has faced other medical challenges in the past, we have managed to address them. He is insured; however, due to previous medical expenses, the insurance company is unable to cover the full cost of his surgery. Therefore, we kindly request any assistance in the form of donations to help our precious baby regain his health and mobility. Milo will require several months of hydrotherapy and physiotherapy to achieve the best possible recovery.

I’m 21 years old, and recently I came across something that broke my heart — a young mother cat and her four tiny kittens huddled under a garbage bin near some garages in Brent Cross. They were scared, dirty, and clearly struggling. I knew I couldn’t just walk away. Right now, I’ve managed to safely get two of the kittens — one is at my home and the other is with a friend. The mum cat is still outside with the two remaining kittens, who are too nervous to come near me yet. I did manage to get the mum into a crate at one point, but I didn’t want to separate her from her little ones and leave them alone under the bin, so I let her back out. My plan is to keep going back until I can get them all together safely. On my last visit, I also spotted a ginger cat nearby who looks like he’s in need of vet care too, so I’m hoping to help him as well. I already have a full house with four cats and two dogs, but I couldn’t turn my back on these poor animals. I’ve set up a warm, quiet room ready for when I can bring them in, and the kittens I’ve rescued so far are safe, fed, and getting lots of love. They all need full health checks, vaccinations, flea and worm treatments, and eventually neutering/spaying to break the cycle. Even just the initial consultation fees are high, and with so many animals needing care (plus my own pets), it’s a big financial stretch. I’m doing everything I can to give them a better life — one filled with comfort, safety, and love. Whether they end up staying with me or finding loving forever homes, I want them to be healthy and happy. If you’re able to donate even a little, it would mean the world to me — and to them. Every penny will go directly to their veterinary care and essential supplies like food, litter, and bedding. Thank you so much for reading and for caring.

We have been giving him eye drops for over 3 months now and at times we have had to give him drops 20 times a day which has been so stressful. Its an on going battle to save his only eye which is covered in blisters which can rupture any moment so things are desperate for him, he needs an eye operation called a letterbox procedure so at least he would hopefully have some vision left, we really dont want to have his eye removed if there is another option but we are sinking every penny into it we can get. Unfortunately time is against us as he needs it soon so hes booked in for the 17th at veterinary vision bamber bridge but they want £3740 for the operation , they want half upfront which we can just about cover then the other half the following month which we're struggling to find even when I get paid as I work part time due to health issues and have bills coming out of our ears but if we can raise £500 or as close as possible it would help massively in paying for his operation. When we rescued him in December just gone he was close to death extremely underweight with a blind eye so we thought. We took him to our vets and it turned out that he had an ulcer which burst inside his eye causing it to leak so we had to have his eye taken out to save him. He also has hyperthyroidism so we now treat him for that every day. Recently he has just been diagnosed with stage 2 kidney failure so he is on special food for early stage renal to help manage it. We are dedicated to helping this little boy and have spent over £6,000 of our own money on him but times are hard we have struggled to cover our cats vets bills as they all have underlying problems so they are uninsurable making all vet bills fall on our shoulders. They are all rescue cats that nobody wanted and gave up on, but not us we have sold our furniture our belongings to get them back on there feet when they needed it as nobody would do it for them. We just need a little help to save his eye, he can't loose it like he did the other one and never see again so please if you can spare anything then please donate what ever you can not for us but for him, hes the most loving cuddly caring cat we have ever had the privilege of knowing, he deserves a chance to see again.\", 'Created 2 September 2025', 'by Dylan for Rent, Food & Monthly Bills']\n",

I tried to give him some food but he ran away and I couldn't find him again . No one knew who he belonged to. The next time I saw him, he was eating out of a council bin. I went a got him some food and threw it to him as he was very wary of me. After some time, I was able to gain his trust and encouraged others to help feed him wheni wasn'taround. He was sunburnt and completely flea ridden (you could see them crawling all over him in the daytime and even across his eyes). His back fur was matted so badly that he couldn't even turn around to groom himself properly. The fleas and inability to clean himself weren't his main priorities, his only concern was surviving. After weeks of getting him to trust me, he would sit on my lap in my car and sleep in the warmth. I didn't care that he was soaking wet and flea ridden, it was just nice to see him happy and relaxed. I decided to try and catch him to take him home with me. He has now been living with us for around a year and has been a light in the house. He loves to cuddle and sleeps with us in the bed every night, purring away as he kneads his blanket. Early on after we got him, we noticed that he couldn't pass urine so we took him in for an emergency appointment. At the time, the vet found crystals in his urethra and several broken teeth (I assume from his foraging days). This bladder crystals have progressed and now developed into bladder stones which requires surgery and constant treatment. We don't want to put him down, which was one of the options the vet gave us. He is a surviver but we are struggling to support him.\", 'Created 13 September 2025', 'by Dylan for Rent, Food & Monthly Bills']\n",

I think it’s fair to say he has had more than his fair share of health issues over the years but mainly from his allergies which despite our best efforts we’ve never found the reason for. He has always had a good insurance policy and it has paid for his medication over the years and also his previous two operations. However due to a persistent and very nasty ear infection we have recently found ourselves facing Vet bills nearing 5 figures for an operation to remove his ear canal to rid him of his infection. His insurance will only go so far and we’re not in the position to be able to afford much more beyond that as I am 1 person working to provide for 4 people and two dogs. We are at the point where we will try anything to help him out and get him out of almost constant pain hence this fund raiser.

I’ve paid in excess of £4500 so far. This week we also received the news Tulip has a melting ulcer in her right eye and she is currently on 4 med drops 4x per day in addition to oral medication in a bid to heal the ulcer. Unfortunately she is facing a further op to save the sight in her right eye. The second op is likely to be in excess of £4500 and whilst I’m still fighting with the insurers on the first op I think it’s highly unlikely they will pay out on a second op. I’m therefore asking for any donations to help me to save this little lady’s sight.. get her back to full health and give her the loving life she so deserves. If you’d like to meet Tulip to see the sweet little pup she is despite the ongoing treatment she’s having, I’d be happy to facilitate. Many thanks for taking the time to read.. if you’ve got this far!!', 'Created 2 August 2025', 'by Dylan for Rent, Food & Monthly Bills']\n",

Rhea was found as a street dog in 2021 in Bosnia. She was approx. 4 years old when she was found. She spent her days roaming the streets in a large city with other dogs, scavenging and fighting her corner, trying to keep warm on cold nights in doorways or trying to stay cool in the shade in the hot summers. Rhea was one of the lucky ones! She didn't get euthanised. I don't know why. May be it was her gentle nature. She was taken in by a charity in Bosnia, then in 2023 Help4Paws dog charity heard of her plight and decided to get her treated by the vet so she could make her way by land over to the UK, where she would stay in their foster home with 20+ dogs in Sussex, awaiting her forever home. I'd noticed a post about Rhea as the social post said that she was being overlooked, probably due to her age and she'd been there quite some time. Our other dog died a year prior so we wanted to fill the void and give another rescue a chance. Rhea came to join our family in April 2024. My daughter adores her. They are very close. Rhea has really found her feet with us and enjoys every aspect of life: the warmth of the fire in the winter, the shade on the cool stone slabs in the summer, long walks and play time and of course lots of snuggles from us.\", 'Created 8 July 2025']\n",

Sounds easy right? It wasn’t. The dog (large breed) had a bite history, and most rescues wouldn’t touch her - she was not suitable for rehoming. Then Doris Banham Dog Rescue stepped in - they said they would take her if we could raise enough money for 6 months emergency boarding, which we did. Doris Banham will not put a dog to sleep, they work hard with their dogs, and with trainers, to help the dog heal from what has happened in their past, but this takes time, and money.

However we took her into our family to give her as much love as we could for her short life. We took her on with underlying health issues meaning if I got insurance any issues wouldnt be covered. We have now been given the choice as time has ran out to get a scan costing £1500 plus consultation £260 then attempt to medically manage her liver shunt (this isnt guarenteed to work as medicine only works on some pups) or put her to sleep. We understand no matter what we wont have many years with Lily but we do want to try this last option to give her more time. Shes an angel. To know her is to love her. The surgery to fix this would be starting at 12k and again not guarenteed and we simply wouldnt ask this. So we would love to raise enough to cover the scan and then I will pay the medicine for as long as it may work.
